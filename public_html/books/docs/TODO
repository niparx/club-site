Features for next version
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
- (* IMPLEMENTED *)
  Confirmation code option. A random code that users should provide
  in order to sign the guestbook. This will help avoid guestbook being
  signed by bots (if not willing to use the moderation queue option).
 
FUTURE FEATURES
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
- Improve administration interface.
- Improve multilingual interface.

ROADMAP to version 0.8
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
- Full code rewrite (cleanup).
- YapGB will be implemented as a class, so that it's easy to use it
  as an extension (it's possible to do it right now, but class
  encapsulation should make it better).
- Standardize variable names (specially session ones).
- Implement a bunch of auxiliary functions, such as getting/showing
  latest X entries from guestbook.
- Implement multilanguage system messages. It will be implemented
  along with class encapsulation.
- Implement guestbook configuration through administration interface.
