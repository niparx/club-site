* comments

0.7.2
  + This version includes three translated gb_lang files: Dutch, Italian and
    Spanish, they're located within lang/ folder.
  + Email and url links are now enabled separately.
  - Allowed HTML tags were not working, now they work again.
  - In Internet Explorer 6 (and later), confirmation code was not shown
    (when working as image) if the guestbook was included in a frame from
    an external url. It was caused by IE default third party cookies settings,
    it has been fixed in this version of YapGB but not enabled by default, you'll
    need to open yapgb.php file and uncomment line number 2 by deleting the two
    slashes (/) at the beginning of the instruction:
    //header('P3P: CP="CAO PSA OUR"');
    So you'll have something like this:
    header('P3P: CP="CAO PSA OUR"');
0.7.1
  - If there was an error in signing form and GD library was not available,
    confirmation code was not shown.
    There is no problem if GD library is available since the bug occured only
    when trying to show confirmation code as text only, not as an image.
0.7
  + Added the option to require the user to enter a confirmation code when
    signing the guestbook. Since previous "anti-spam" options didn't work
    completely, this will the best option to prevent automated signing of the
    guestbook.
  + Email and URL links are optinally shown to visitors, they're always shown
    to administrator.
  + New error notification method. Errors are shown on signing page, signing form
    is automatically filled in with previously entered data.
  - It was possible to post empty name/message entries.

0.6.1
  - Referer checking is disabled when it's an empty value. Some browsers don't
    create this value and some users wouldn't be able to sign the guestbook even
    when coming from the guestbook sign page (when $cfgEnableTrustedURIs is set
    to 1).
  + Added some session vars creation when showing the sign page, these session
    variables are checked when adding a new entry, this will help assure the user
    has visited the sign page. This is a quick fix because the trusted URIs feature
    is not helping to prevent spam since it relies on the HTTP_REFERER variable
    (this variable keeps the referer page, but it depends on the user's agent can be
    modified by the user or may not be present, so it is not useful).
  + Added a new temp_signsuccesful.html file to the theme structure, it will be used
    for showing a sign successful message after users have signed the guestbook.

0.6
  * All YapGB files are now saved with UTF-8 codification and in Unix format
    (new lines are \n and not \r\n as in DOS/Windows).
  * All guestbook functions are now "gb" prefixed, as in gbYapGBInfo();
  * Guestbook files are now "gb" prefixed: config.php, func.php, admin.php
    and lang_xx.php are now gbconfig.php, gbfunc.php, gbadmin.php and gblang_xx.php.
  * Configuration variables are now "$cfg" prefixed.
  * Moved most YapGB messages to a separate file (gblang_en.php), so
    translation/customization should be easier now.
  - Burkhard Masseida fixed javascript injection flaw in BBCode implementation
    (THANK YOU!). You can contact him at <reisswolf_nospam [AT] otzenpunkrock.de>.
  + Administrator must login before editing/deleting entries (so password will be
    supplied just once, not every time an entry would be edited).
    Now temp_message.html theme files should include the new
    <!--GB_ENTRYADMINLINK-->
    GB_TAG, it will be replaced by a link to the edit/delete page but only when
    administrator has logged in.
    This administration link will try to use a gbadminlink.gif image within current
    theme's directory. Themes included with this release (melody1 and gbwhite) have been
    updated and already include it.
  + Added a list of trusted URIs, to prevent remote spam scripts attacks.
  + Added a "minimun wait" time, so users can't add another post after posting once.
  + Added moderation queue option.
  + Added <!--GB_ENTRYEMAILLINK--> and <!--GB_ENTRYURLLINK--> GB_TAGS, these should
    be used in temp_message.html to show links to entries' email and URL links. These
    tags will show links only when the entry includes them.
    The links provided by these tags will look for gbemail.gif and gburl.gif image files
    within current themes directory.

0.5.1 (Nov 7th, 2004)
  - Entries could not be deleted with register_globals disabled.
    Thanks to Michele Bugliaro Goggia for helping me find it.

0.5 (Nov 2nd, 2004)
  + YapGB now supports smilies and BBCode.
    Smilies and BBCode functions are enabled through configuration variables
    in config.php.
  + Added the help.php file to YapGB structure. This file will be used for
    showing some help hints to users signing the guestbook. Currently it
    includes information about the BBCode available in YapGB.
  + Improved security when deleting entries. Now the date field is checked
    to avoid wrong deletion (it was low probable, but could happen if two
    people could access the admin page and were deleting entries at the
    same time).
    Every temp_admin.html file now includes the line
    <input type="hidden" name="date" value"<!--GB_ENTRYDATEINT-->">
    so that the date field (in integer format) is passed to the deletion
    script. Before deleting and entry, the date is checked against the entry
    being deleted, if it does not match, the entry can not be deleted.
    You must add this line to your current temp_admin.html theme file, if not,
    you won't be able to delete entries.
  - Corrected a bug with pagination links: the final page number was being
    omitted, now it appears correctly. Thanks to Dan Edwards for the
    correction.
  * melody1 theme has been considered as the "default" theme. If a temp_xx.html
    file does not exist in the current theme folder, YapGB will use the one
    in themes/melody1/ instead.

0.4.2 (Aug 22, 2004)
  + Custom timezone option.
  + Added an option to notify admin of new posts added.
  + Small modifications to email and url checking functions.
  - Corrected the "bug" with the JavaScript function inside themes that
    overrided the "email not necessary" PHP command. Now the JavaScript
    function only checks for the name and message fields, but the email
    checking can be enabled by uncommenting some lines in the script, it
    can be done by editing the temp_body.html theme file.
  * The included empty entries text file is now named entries_empty.txt
    in order to avoid problems with existing entries.txt files from
    earlier versions (this mimizes the possibility of losing your entries
    if you were upgrading from a previous version).
  + A new theme: gbwhite.
  * This release includes only two themes: melody1 and gbwhite (new). Other
    themes can be downloaded at http://www.hewop.com/~yapgb/themes.php.

0.4.1 (May 26, 2004)
  + Added email and url checking inside the PHP script. The script did not
    include these functions before, email and url were tested using a
    small function written in JavaScript, which is really useful and fast,
    but not secure since someone could easily crash the guestbook.
    I'd recommend to still use the JavaScript function since it is really
    fast (it executes inmediately on users' browsers, so they don't need
    to wait until the data is sent and checked by the server), but now
    YapGB is more secure since it will internally make sure that the
    introduced email and/or url are valid.

0.4 (May 19, 2004)
  * YapGB v0.4 is being released under the terms of the GNU General
    Public License, see the enclosed license.txt file for full details.
  - Back-slashes bug has been finally fixed. Back-slashes won't appear on
    new entries, but if you have an entries file from previous versions and
    still see the slashes, you'll have to edit those messages by yourself
    (just use the modify option).
  + Added an option to "hide" visitors' emails. Instead of showing
    mymail@mydomain.com it will be mymail [at] mydomain [dot] com
  + Added a new func.php file where all YapGB functions will be located.
  + Added message variables to the config.php. I'm thinking of having
    language files for translating YapGB messages.
  + Pagination improved a bit, now YapGB does not show links to all pages.
    It is useful for guest books with lots of entries.
  + Three more date GB_TAGS: <!--GB_ENTRYDAYNAME--> (full name of day),
    <!--GB_ENTRYMONTHNAME--> (full month name) and <!--GB_ENTRYYEARFULL-->
    (year in four digits format).
  + Added a word censoring function, it is really simple and will be
    improved in a future release.
  + Added a word lenght limit function, now you can set the maximum lenght
    of words using the $gbMaxWordLenght variable.
  + This release includes a new theme: "plouves" by Michael Marcon (aka cmic).
    Note: all text in theme is in French.

0.3.1 (Jan 20th, 2004)
  - Corrected the page bug when register_globals is disabled. It was not
    modified to work with register_globals disabled, now it is.

0.3 (Jan 16th, 2004)
  + Allows modification of entries (date can't be edited).
  + Added a temp_modify.html file to the theme structure, it is used
    by the modify entry option. Also, temp_admin.html has a small
    change to let select between 'modify' and 'delete' actions.
  + Added a <!--GB_ENTRYDATEINT--> special tag, it is used in
    temp_modify.html file for getting the date of the entry in integer
    format, since the update option needs it in order to correctly update
    the entry.
  - Corrected bug when showing quotes ("), single quotes ('), back
    slashes (\) and vertical bars (|).
  + Updated 'melody1' theme, added the new temp_modify.html file.
  * Changed all references to $PHP_SELF in yapgb.php to $gbIndex (this
    variable is defined in config.php).
  * Now YapGB should work correctly with register_globals disabled
    (register_globals is a PHP configuration variable defined in the
    php.ini file.)
  * Changed admin.php structure (a bit).
  + HTML tags in name, email and url fields are now completely eliminated,
    they were not in previous version. HTML tags in these fields (name, email
    and url) are completely stripped, it's a matter of security. Remember
    that you can define which HTML tags can be used in the message field with
    the variable $gbAllowedTags in config.php.
  + Two new themes: 'geored' and 'geogreen'.

0.21 (Jan 11th, 2004)
  - Deleted debugging instructions, such as the numbers appearing
    after every message entry, I used them for testing purposes, but
    forgot to delete them before releasing the files :P.

0.2 (Jan 6th, 2004)
  - Corrected a bug when deleting entries. I noticed this bug when
    I was just about to release YapGB for download. When selecting
    an entry in order to delete it, the admin.php file needs the
    line number (id) of the entry in the file, but if at the moment
    before deleting it a new entry was added, all of the entries
    change line number and a wrong entry would be deleted. Now new
    entries are added to the end of the storing file (appended) so
    that all previous entries keep their line number (until one is
    deleted, that is).
  - Corrected a strange behaviour when deleting entries: after
    deleting an entry some "strange" characters would appear at the
    end of the lines, it was because the entries were acquired by using
    the file() function, and to delete an entry all entries starting
    at the deleted one would take the value of the next one, then
    the lines array was saved again to the file, in this process
    some characters were introduced. Actually, it wasn't a problem,
    since the guest book worked with no problems, but when opening the
    entries file in WorPad (not NotePad) or similar many blank lines
    would appear.
  * This is a beta version, v1.0 will appear after testing this one
    for a while.

  + Plain text file for storing book entries.
