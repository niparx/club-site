WHAT IS IT?
~~~~~~~~~~~
   YapGB is a completely free guestbook system written in PHP.

FEATURES
~~~~~~~~
  - Allows deletion/modification of entries.
  - No database needed (it uses a plain text file).
  - Fully customizable appearance through a themes system.
  - Bad words censoring.
  - Custom guestbook's timezone.
  - Smilies and BBCode support.
  - Moderation queue.
  - Custom sign succesful page.

REQUIREMENTS
~~~~~~~~~~~~
   In order to be able tu use YapGB, you need:
  - access to PHP scripting service,
  - access to setting file permissions on your web space
    (only if your host is an Unix based server).

IMPORTANT NOTES
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
  Version 0.7.x:
  - Version 0.7 adds the option to require the user to introduce a
    confirmation code when signing the guestbook, in order to avoid automated
    signing. This option is enable by default, and requires a new GB_TAG to
    be included in temp_sign.html file. This new GB_TAG is
    <!--GB_CONFIRMCODE-->, it will be replaced by a X characters confirmation
    code.
  - Version 0.7 has a new error notification method, when the script finds
    errors in data entered by the user, it reloads the sign page and fills in
    previously entered data (so that it's not lost as before, annoying the user),
    and errors are shown using the new <!--GB_SIGNERRORS--> GB_TAG, you can place
    it wherever you want in temp_sign.html file.
    In order to allow the script to fill signing form fields automatically, name,
    email and message input fields in temp_sign.html have been change from:

    <input type="text" name="name" />
    <input type="text" name="email" />
    <input type="text" name="url" />
    <textarea name="message"></textarea>

    to:

    <input type="text" name="name" value="<!--GB_ENTRYNAME--> />
    <input type="text" name="url" value="<!--GB_ENTRYURL-->" />
    <input type="text" name="url" value="<!--GB_ENTRYURL-->" />
    <textarea name="message"><!--GB_ENTRYMESSAGE--></textarea>

  Version 0.6.1:
  - Version 0.6.1 introduces the ability to show a succesful page after
    the user has signed the guestbook. This succesful page is loaded from
    a new temp_signsuccesful.html file located within current theme's
    directory (or by default from melody1 theme). If you enable this option,
    you'll need to add this new temp_signsuccesful.html file to your current
    theme.

  Version 0.6:
  - YapGB files and functions are "gb" prefixed, as in gbadmin.php or gbYapGBInfo().
  - temp_message.html should use the new <!--GB_ENTRYADMINLINK--> GB_TAG instead of
    a direct link to administration interface.
  - The new <!--GB_ENTRYEMAILLINK--> and <!--GB_ENTRYURLLINK--> GB_TAGs should be used
    to show entries' email and url links.
    These GB_TAGS will show email and/or URL links only when they exist. Also, these
    tags will look for gbemail.gif and gburl.gif images within current theme directory.
    Themes included with this release (melody1 and gbwhite) have already been updated
    and work correctly with these changes.
  - Read the CHANGELOG file in the docs/ directory for a detailed list of changes.

  Version 0.5:
  - Since version 0.5, temp_admin.html theme files will need this line:
    <input type="hidden" name="date" value="<!--GB_ENTRYDATEINT-->">
    within the deleteMessage form.
    Please add it to your current temp_admin.html theme file to be able
    to delete entries. Themes included with version 0.5 (melody1 and gbwhite)
    have already been edited to include it.

INSTALLATION
~~~~~~~~~~~~
   Just copy yapgb.php, gbconfig.php, gbadmin.php, gbfunc.php and gbhelp.php files
  and the lang/, themes/ and smilies/ folders to a directory in your webspace.
   yapgb.php is the main YapGB file, you can rename it to whatever you like
  (e.g. guestbook.php) but remember to update the $cfgGBIndex variable in
  gbconfig.php.
   Next, you have to create a text file where YapGB will store the entries, or you
  can just upload the included entries_empty.txt file and rename it to whatever
  you want.
   If your site is on an Un*x based server (Linux, FreeBSD, etc.), next step is
  to set proper file permissions so that YapGB can read/write from/to the necessary
  files:
  - themes/, smilies/ and lang/ directories need read permission for "other users".
  - Entries file needs read and write permissions for "other users".
   You'll need to use the chmod command to set these permissions, if you don't know
  how to use chmod, you can find a nice tutorial at:
  http://www.zachjorgensen.net/za/chmodtutor.html
  
   Last step is to edit the configuration variables in gbconfig.php, please read next
  section before doing so.

CONFIGURATION
~~~~~~~~~~~~~
   In order to make YapGB work correctly, you should also edit the
  gbconfig.php file, open it in a text editor (I recommend you to use
  a plain text editor such as Notepad, you can use any other as long
  as you save the file as text only) and look for these lines:

  #~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~#
  # YapGB configuration variables #
  #~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~#

   Below this message, you'll find YapGB configuration variables, edit
  them as required (the content is fully commented so you can easily
  edit it if you don't have any experience with PHP).
   I strongly reccomend you to edit these ones:
  - $cfgAdminName and $cfgAdminPass, administrator login data.
  - $cfgTitle, your guestbook's title.
  - $cfgEntriesFile, the file to store entries to.
  - $cfgGBIndex, main YapGB file name (yapgb.php or whatever you renamed it to).
  - $cfgGBURI, full URL to main YapGB file.
  - $cfgSiteIndex, your main site index. Used by the "back to site" link.

THEMES
~~~~~~
   YapGB lets you modify its appearance through the use of "themes".
   Read the docs/themeinfo.txt file for detailed information on the themes
  structure, so that you can either edit the included ones or create
  your own.
