Upgrading to latest version (from any previous one)
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
- Back up your entries file.
- Delete all YapGB related files, except the entries file.
- Upload latest version of YapGB.
- Edit gbconfig.php as required.

Upgrading to version 0.7.2 (from 0.7.1)
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
- Back up your entries file.
- Replace your existing yapgb.php and gbfunc.php files for those included in new version.
- Update your configuration file, you can either:
  - (easy option) replace your current gbconfig.php file for the new one (but you'll need
    to edit ALL of your configuration options again!).
  - (fast option) or edit your current gbconfig.php file:
    Email and URL links are now enabled to users separately, this is the
    only change in configuration. The only thing you'll need is to open
    gbconfig.php file, go to (almost) the end of the file and look for this
    line:
  
    $cfgShowLinksOnlyToAdmin = 1;
  
    Now, replace it with these:

    # Show Email and URL links to visitors.
    # Email and Url links are always shown to administrator (when logged in).
    # To show visitors' email and url links set these variables as needed.
    # 1 = show link. 0 = do not show.
    $cfgShowEmailLink = 0;
    $cfgShowUrlLink = 1;
  
    And set $cfgShowEmailLink and $cfgShowUrlLink to 0 (do not show) or 1 (show
    links to users) as you need.
- That's it.

Upgrading to version 0.7.1 (from 0.7)
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
- There is only one difference between these versions: a small change
  in gbSwapConfirmCode() function in gbfunc.php file.
  The only thing you need to do is replace your existing gbfunc.php
  file with the new one.

Upgrading to version 0.7.1 (from 0.6)
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
- Same as upgrading to 0.7, read below.

Upgrading to version 0.7 (from 0.6)
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
- Back up your entries file.
- Replace your existing yapgb.php and gbfunc.php files for those included in new version.
- Update your configuration file, you can either:
  - replace your current gbconfig.php file for the new one (but you'll need
    to edit your configuration options again!). This is the recommended option.
  - or edit your current gbconfig.php file and add these lines just before the
    '?>' at the end of the file:

	-----------------------------
   # Show a sign succesful page.
   # If set to 1, after signing the guesbook, it will show the temp_signsuccesful.html file
   # (located within current theme's directory) to the user.
   # If set to 0, the main guestbook page will be showed after signing the guestbook.
   $cfgShowSuccesfulPage = 1;
   # Confirmation code
   # If set to 1, the user is required to enter a confirmation code in order
   # to sign the guestbook.
   $cfgEnableConfirmationCode = 1;

   # Show links only to admin
   # If set to 1, entries' email and url links won't be showed unless
   # administrator has logged in.
   $cfgShowLinksOnlyToAdmin = 1;
	-----------------------------

   Version 0.7 adds these three new configuration options.
   If you set $cfgShowSuccesfulPage to 1, you will need a temp_signsuccesful.html file within
   your current theme's directory. Check the temp_signsuccesful.html in melody1 theme for a
   very simple example of what you can do with this new file.

- Update your temp_sign.html template file:
  Version 0.7 adds the option to require the user to introduce a
  confirmation code when signing the guestbook, in order to avoid automated
  signing. This option is enable by default, and requires a new GB_TAG to
  be included in temp_sign.html file. This new GB_TAG is
  <!--GB_CONFIRMCODE-->, it will be replaced by a X characters confirmation
  code.
  Version 0.7 has a new error notification method, when the script finds
  errors in data entered by the user, it reloads the sign page and fills in
  previously entered data (so that it's not lost as before, annoying the user),
  and errors are shown using the new <!--GB_SIGNERRORS--> GB_TAG, you can place
  it wherever you want in temp_sign.html file.
  In order to allow the script to fill signing form fields automatically, name,
  email and message input fields in temp_sign.html have been change from:

    <input type="text" name="name" />
    <input type="text" name="email" />
    <input type="text" name="url" />
    <textarea name="message"></textarea>

    to:

    <input type="text" name="name" value="<!--GB_ENTRYNAME--> />
    <input type="text" name="url" value="<!--GB_ENTRYURL-->" />
    <input type="text" name="url" value="<!--GB_ENTRYURL-->" />
    <textarea name="message"><!--GB_ENTRYMESSAGE--></textarea>


Upgrading to version 0.6.1 (from 0.6)
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
- Back up your entries file.
- Replace your existing yapgb.php file for the one in the new version.
- Update your configuration file, you can either:
  - replace your current gbconfig.php file for the new one (but you'll need
    to edit your configuration options again!).
  - or edit your current gbconfig.php file and add these lines just before the
    '?>' at the end of the file:

	-----------------------------
	# Show a sign succesful page.
	# If set to 1, after signing the guesbook, it will show the temp_signsuccesful.html file
	# (located within current theme's directory) to the user.
	# If set to 0, the main guestbook page will be showed after signing the guestbook.
	$cfgShowSuccesfulPage = 1;
	-----------------------------

    $cfgShowSuccesfulPage is the only addition to configuration options, if you set its value
    to 1, you will need a temp_signsuccesful.html file in your current theme's directory.
    Check the temp_signsuccesful.html in melody1 theme for a very simple example of what you
    can do with this new file.

Upgrading to version 0.6 (from 0.5 or 0.5.1)
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

- Back up your entries file (download and save it) for security.
  (You should back it up on a regular basis).
- Delete yapgb.php (the main YapGB file).
- Upload the new yapgb.php file, gbadmin.php, gbconfig.php and
  gbhelp.php. Also, upload the lang/ directory and its content.
- Upload the new versions of melody1 and gbwhite themes. If you
  are using a custom theme, you should read the themesinfo.txt to
  see the changes you'll need to do to your theme so that it works
  correctly with this new version, you can use melody1 in
  the meantime :).
- You'll need to edit the configuration options once again, they're
  located in the gbconfig.php file.
- Now you can delete admin.php, func.php, config.php and help.php
  files from previous version.
- And we're done upgrading to version 0.6!

Upgrading to version 0.5.1 (or 0.5)
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

When upgrading, you need to change almost the whole system,
these are the steps required:

- Backup your entries file (download and save it) for security
  (I'd recommend you back it up regularly)
- Delete your yapgb.php, config.php, admin.php and func.php files.
  This is because all these files have changed since vesions 0.4.x
- Upload the new files yapgb.php, admin.php, func.php and help.php.
- Edit config.php as required.
- Now modify your current theme to work with version 0.5.1, read
  below.

THEMES in version 0.5.1 (and 0.5)

The temp_admin.html files have changed, now they need to include
this line:
  <input type="hidden" name="date" value="<!--GB_ENTRYDATEINT-->">
within the deleteMessage form in order to be able to delete entries,
this is because the date is matched before deleting an entry.

But you don't need to edit your temp_admin.html files if you don't
want to ;), since now melody1 theme is considered as default, you
can just delete your temp_admin.html file from your current theme
folder and and YapGB will use the one in the melody1 theme folder.
But you must upload melody1 theme :D.

That's it, now you should be able to use YapGB version 0.5.1 :).

Also, since this new version supports smilies, maybe you'll want to
include a "quick smilies menu" in your signing page, check out the
temp_sign.html files in themes melody1 and gbwhite to have an idea
how to make it.
